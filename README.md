#  What is a Wireframe?

A **wireframe** is a simple visual representation of a web page or app layout.  
It's like a blueprint — it helps you plan where things will go *before* you start designing or coding.

Wireframes focus on **structure**, not style. That means no colors, images, or fancy fonts — just the essentials:

- Where the **logo** will be placed  
- Where the **buttons**, **text**, and **images** should go  
- How users will **navigate or interact** with the page  

Think of it as sketching your idea before turning it into a working website.

##  Why Use a Wireframe?

Wireframes are incredibly useful for many reasons:

- **Quickly visualize** your idea  
- Plan the **user experience (UX)** early  
- Save time for both **designers and developers**  
- Make changes easily before writing real code  

Wireframing is a smart first step in the web development process. It helps you and your team stay on the same page and build with clarity.

 ِand We can create wireframes on paper, or use tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD.*
